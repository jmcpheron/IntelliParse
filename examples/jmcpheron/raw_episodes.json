    "summary": "Today we\u2019re joined by Sherry Yang, senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and a PhD student at UC Berkeley. In this interview, we discuss her new paper, \"Video as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making,\u201d which explores how generative video models can play a role similar to language models as a way to solve tasks in the real world. Sherry draws the analogy between natural language as a unified representation of information and text prediction as a common task interface and demonstrates how video as a medium and generative video as a task exhibit similar properties. This formulation enables video generation models to play a variety of real-world roles as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators. Finally, we explore UniSim, an interactive demo of Sherry's work and a preview of her vision for interacting with AI-generated environments.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/676.",

    "summary": "Today we\u2019re joined by Heather Nolis, a principal machine learning engineer at T-Mobile. In our conversation with Heather, we explored her machine learning journey at T-Mobile, including their initial proof of concept project, which held the goal of putting their first real-time deep learning model into production. We discuss the use case, which aimed to build a model customer intent model that would pull relevant information about a customer during conversations with customer support. This process has now become widely known as blank assist. We also discuss the decision to use supervised learning to solve this problem and the challenges they faced when developing a taxonomy. Finally, we explore the idea of using small models vs uber-large models, the hardware being used to stand up their infrastructure, and how Heather thinks about the age-old question of build vs buy.",

Many tools available off the shelf, both commercial and open source, can help.\nAt the extremes, these tools can fall into one of a couple of buckets. End-to-end platforms that try to provide support for many aspects of the ML lifecycle, and specialized tools that offer deep functionality in a particular domain or area.\nAt TWIMLcon: AI Platforms 2022, our panelists debated the merits of these approaches in The Great MLOps Debate: End-to-End ML Platforms vs Specialized Tools.",

We set the stage by digging into some of fundamental ideas behind Numenta\u2019s research and the present landscape of neuroscience, before exploring our first big topic of the podcast: the cortical column. Cortical columns are a group of neurons in the cortex of the brain which have nearly identical receptive fields; we discuss the behavior of these columns, why they\u2019re a structure worth mimicing computationally, how far along we are in understanding the cortical column, and how these columns relate to neurons.\n\u00a0\nWe also discuss what it means for a model to have inherent 3d understanding and for computational models to be inherently sensory motor, and where we are with these lines of research. Finally, we dig into our other big idea, sparsity. We explore the fundamental ideals of sparsity and the differences between sparse and dense networks, and applying sparsity and optimization to drive greater efficiency in current deep learning networks, including transformers and other large language models.\u00a0\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/562",

    "summary": "Take our survey at twimlai.com/survey21!\n\nToday we\u2019re joined by Tim Rockt\u00e4schel, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research and an associate professor at University College London (UCL).\u00a0\n\nTim\u2019s work focuses on training RL agents in simulated environments, with the goal of these agents being able to generalize to novel situations. Typically, this is done in environments like OpenAI Gym, MuJuCo, or even using Atari games, but these all come with constraints. In Tim\u2019s approach, he utilizes a game called NetHack, which is much more rich and complex than the aforementioned environments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn our conversation with Tim, we explore the ins and outs of using NetHack as a training environment, including how much control a user has when generating each individual game and the challenges he's faced when deploying the agents. We also discuss his work on MiniHack, an environment creation framework and suite of tasks that are based on NetHack, and future directions for this research.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/527.",

We had the pleasure of reconnecting with Greg on the heels of the announcement of Codex, OpenAI\u2019s most recent release. Codex is a direct descendant of GPT-3 that allows users to do autocomplete tasks based on all of the publicly available text and code on the internet. In our conversation with Greg, we explore the distinct results Codex sees in comparison to GPT-3, relative to the prompts it's being given, how it could evolve given different types of training data, and how users and practitioners should think about interacting with the API to get the most out of it. We also discuss Copilot, their recent collaboration with Github that is built on Codex, as well as the implications of Codex on coding education, explainability, and broader societal issues like fairness and bias, copyrighting, and jobs.\u00a0\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/509.",

As most of you undoubtedly know by now, there has been much controversy surrounding, and fallout from, this paper. In this conversation, our main priority was to focus on the message of the paper itself. We spend some time discussing the historical context for the paper, then turn to the goals of the paper, discussing the many reasons why the ever-growing datasets and models are not necessarily the direction we should be going.\u00a0\n We explore the cost of these training datasets, both literal and environmental, as well as the bias implications of these models, and of course the perpetual debate about responsibility when building and deploying ML systems. Finally, we discuss the thin line between AI hype and useful AI systems, and the importance of doing pre-mortems to truly flesh out any issues you could potentially come across prior to building models, and much much more.\u00a0\n The complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/467.",

    "summary": "In this episode, I speak with Ksenia Konyushkova, Ph.D. student in the CVLab at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland. Ksenia and I connected at NIPS in December to discuss her interesting research into ways we might apply machine learning to ease the challenge of creating labeled datasets for machine learning. The first paper we discuss is \u201cLearning Active Learning from Data,\u201d which suggests a data-driven approach to active learning that trains a secondary model to identify the unlabeled data points which, when labeled, would likely have the greatest impact on our primary model\u2019s performance. We also discuss her paper \u201cLearning Intelligent Dialogs for Bounding Box Annotation,\u201d in which she trains an agent to guide the actions of a human annotator to more quickly produce bounding boxes.

Kenneth\u2019s research focus is what he calls Neuroevolution, applies the idea of genetic algorithms to the challenge of evolving neural network architectures. In this conversation, we discuss the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (or NEAT) paper that Kenneth authored along with Risto, which won the 2017 International Society for Artificial Life\u2019s Award for Outstanding Paper of the Decade 2002 - 2012. We also cover some of the extensions to that approach he\u2019s created since, including, HyperNEAT, which can efficiently evolve very large networks with connectivity patterns that look more like those of the human and that are generally much larger than what prior approaches to neural learning could produce, and novelty search, an approach which unlike most evolutionary algorithms has no defined objective, but rather simply searches for novel behaviors. We also cover concepts like \u201cComplexification\u201d and \u201cDeception\u201d, biology vs computation including differences and similarities, and some of his other work including his book, and NERO, a video game complete with Real-time Neuroevolution.

We packed a ton into this conversation, especially keying in on her recently released paper \u201cUsing Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US\u201d. Timnit describes the pipeline she developed for this research, and some of the challenges she faced building and end-to-end model based on google street view images, census data and commercial car vendor data. We also discuss the role of social awareness in her work, including an explanation of how domain adaptation and fairness are related and her view of the major research directions in the domain of fairness.

In this episode, I speak with Matthew Taylor, Open Source Manager at Numenta. You might remember hearing a bit about Numenta from an interview I did with Francisco Weber of Cortical.io, for TWiML Talk #10, a show which remains the most popular show on the podcast. Numenta is basically trying to reverse-engineer the neocortex, and use what they learn to develop a neocortical theory for biological and machine intelligence called Hierarchical Temporal Memory. Matt joined me at the conference to discuss his talk \u201cThe Biological Path Towards Strong AI\u201d. In our conversation, we discuss the basics of HTM, it\u2019s biological inspiration, and how it differs from traditional neural network models including deep learning. This is a Nerd Alert show, and after you listen I would encourage you to check out the conversation with Francisco which we\u2019ll link to in the show notes.

    "date": "Wed, 05 Jul 2017 00:00:00 -0000",
    "summary": "My guest for this second show in our O\u2019Reilly AI series is Doug Eck of Google Brain. Doug did a keynote at the O\u2019Reilly conference on Magenta, Google\u2019s project for melding machine learning and the arts. Magenta\u2019s goal is to produce open-source tools and models that help people in their personal creative processes. Doug\u2019s research starts with using so-called \u201cgenerative\u201d machine learning models to create engaging media. Additionally, he is working on how to bring other aspects of the creative process into play. We talk about the newly announced Performance RNN project, which uses neural networks to create expressive, AI-generated music. We also touch on QuickDraw, a project by Google AI Experiments, in which users as Doug describes it, \u201cplay Pictionary\u201d with a visual classifier. We dig into what he foresees as possibilities for Magenta, machine learning models eventually developing storylines, generative models for media and creative coding.

    "summary": "This week we continue our series on industrial applications of machine learning and AI with a conversation with Chelsea Finn, a PhD student at UC Berkeley. Chelsea\u2019s research is focused on machine learning for robotic perception and control. Despite being early in her career, Chelsea is an accomplished researcher with more than 14 published papers in the past 2 years, on subjects like Deep Visual Foresight , Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning and Visuomotor Learning to name a few, all of which we discuss in the show, along with topics like zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot learning. I\u2019d also like to give a shout out to Shreyas, a listener who wrote in to request that we interview a current PhD student about their journey and experiences. Chelsea and I spend some time at the end of the interview talking about this, and she has some great advice for current and prospective PhD students but also independent learners in the field. During this part of the discussion I wonder out loud if any listeners would be interested in forming a virtual paper reading club of some sort. I\u2019m not sure yet exactly what this would look like, but please drop a comment in the show notes if you\u2019re interested. I'm going to once again deploy the Nerd Alert for this episode; Chelsea and I really dig deep into these learning methods and techniques, and this conversation gets pretty technical at times, to the point that I had a tough time keeping up myself.
